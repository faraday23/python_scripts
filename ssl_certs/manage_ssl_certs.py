# This script uses the Certbot tool to automate the creation and management of SSL certificates for a web application. It first sets the DOMAIN_NAME and EMAIL_ADDRESS variables to the domain name for the SSL certificate and the email address for certificate renewal notifications, respectively.

# The script then installs Certbot if it is not already installed using the apt-get command. It creates the SSL certificate using the certbot certonly command, which generates a new SSL certificate and saves it to the Certbot directory. The --standalone flag tells Certbot to run a standalone web server to validate the certificate, and the --non-interactive and --agree-tos flags tell Certbot to automatically accept the terms of service and to not prompt for user input.

# The script also includes a command to renew the SSL certificate when it is about to expire using the certbot renew command. This command automatically checks for any certificates that are expiring soon and renews them if necessary.

# Finally, the script installs the SSL certificate in the web server (example: Apache) using the a2enmod command to enable SSL support and the systemctl restart command to restart the web server.

# To use this script, you will need to replace the DOMAIN_NAME and EMAIL_ADDRESS variables with your own domain name and email address, and modify the a2enmod and systemctl commands to match the web server you are using (if it is different from Apache). Additionally, you will need to run this script with administrative privileges (i.e. as sudo) to allow it to install and manage SSL certificates.
